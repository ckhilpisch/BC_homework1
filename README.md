For my first assignment I was tasked with taking an existing page for a marketing company and refactoring the code to make the page more accesible while still maintaining the current state of the page.  Increasing accessibility will make it a more inclusive website.  It will also help increase the search engine optimization for the webiste which positions the company for more visibility on the web.  
I started with an intial commit and the creation of the folder inside of Github.  
Starting with the header, I was able to remove all of the div tags in the HTML.   I also added the HTML Semantic header element in it's place.  The header had unique coloring of letters, with the middle three letters being a different color.  I removed all ids and classes associated with it and just left the span element in both HTML and CSS.  
I then imbedded a navigation bar inside the header.  I was intially attempting to make the nav bar remain inside the header when the page was reduced.   I spent an exhorbitant amount of time researching how to make this happen.  I then realized it was unnecessary for the completion of the project and begrudgingly moved on.  
I then titled the page as Horiseon Marketing Solutions.  The next step was changing the body of the page.
The background picture was a *fraught* part of the project for me.   It was set up in CSS, even though all of the other images were in HTML.  I was unable to add an alt tag on the CSS side.   I then moved the image over to HTML and ran in to tons of issues with linking it correctly to the page.  I was finally able to figure that out, but when it loaded it was about 10 times larger than it was intially.  I moved to the HMTL side to style the image and was able to have it fit the space correctly.  I  removed all previous styling done on the CSS side for the figure.
Next is the content portion of the page.  I created three sections and an aside.  I intially blocked out the content portion of the code, which would later come to haunt me.   I was able to consolidate all of the images, header tags, and all of the specs that were part of the aside.  I struggled for hours with the aside container, trying different floats and page set ups to make the aside be to the right of the sections.  I was finally able to put it all together once I reengaged the content portion of the code.
I also shortened the names of the section, since the ids for them were very verbose. I also had to change their link in the nav bar after that.   
I removed class tags from all of the images and the sections names.   To clean up the CSS I consolidated all of the elements when able to.  This included h2, h3, images, and text.
With the aside I was able to remove all div tags, create the aside, then combine of the image and header properties contained within.  
I finished up with the footer.   I was able to remove all of the divs and add the footer element.   I also changed the text to bold and increased its size while removing the H2 tag.
The final problem I had with this homework was that the folder file was too large and contained too many unnecessary items in it.   It also did not have the index in the first page with the READme file.   I had to create a completely new repository to container all of the information in a concise manner that made logical sense.   Unfortunately all of my commits were lost as well.  
Here is the link for that original homework folder.

This is just a way you can track my commits and see the progress I made sequencially.
For reference for this assigment I used w3schools.com as a resource. 
I've included photos of the side by side code.   My refactored code is on the left, with the original code on the right.  It is just some snippets to give some insight into the differences.
